# Wrexham AFC Fan Site (Personal Project 2023)

## Project Overview

This repository contains a personal "passion project"â€”a static fan website dedicated to Wrexham AFC. The site was built from scratch to showcase the club's profile, history, and achievements.

This project serves as a portfolio piece demonstrating fundamental front-end web development skills using pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Technology Stack

This website was built using foundational web technologies without any external frameworks.

* **HTML5:** Used for the semantic structure of all pages (profile, history, etc.).
* **CSS3:** Used for all styling, layout (Flexbox/Grid), and animations.
* **JavaScript (ES6+):** Used for any dynamic elements or interactivity (e.g., image sliders, navigation menu toggles).

## Project Status

This is a completed personal project.
